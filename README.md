Using Computational Facial Analysis:
I was able to analyze a large collection of images to derive certain characteristics (age, gender, emotion, Hue, Saturation, Value) about those images and obtain underlying structures through image clustering (which helped me better understand the content of the images) and pick the best clustering solution.

Using Topic Modeling:
I was able to analyze a large collection of documents to discover hidden thematic structures within them. By identifying patterns of co-occurring words, I was able to create a plot to make an educated decision on the optimal number of topics. Then further analyze that number of topics using keywords, document-topic matices, and effects of my covariate on the outcome.
Overall, I was able to gain valuable insights from a large collection of images and text using many different, methods and outputs.
